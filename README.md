#Login-SignIn App

In the time boundation i had, i achieved following features:

KEY POINTS:
- The App was created with vite-react
- React Router DOM was implemented for routing of pages
- Context API and LocalStorage were used for storing user data

GUIDE:
- App will run on Localhost using terminal command in the project folder: 'npm run dev'. 
- LOGIN & SIGNUP button are on the right in header.
- these buttons can be used to toggle between LOGIN-PAGE and SIGNUP-PAGE.
- In SignUp page you can enter the details and create a new user.
- if there is already an existing user with the EMAIL you'll be alerted.
- Signing In or Logging In will redirect you to the "/profile" i.e. Account Settings in this case
- old information will be shown and new information can be Overridden
- logout button will redirect you to the LOGIN PAGE

DEFECTS THAT ARE NOT YET FIXED BECAUSE OF LACK OF TIME :
- The "Save Changes" button not exactly updates the user info, instead it creates a new user with updated info
- All fields are required to Save Changes 
- Few other bugs, for example: when you enter wrong credentials in login and switch to signup it unneccesarily shows "Invalid credentials"






-Wish me luck i have an exam today, therefore i was short in time :(
